          The Greatest Threat to Humanity‚Ä¶ What is the greatest threat to humanity? Some might say that it‚Äôs a nuclear fallout. Others might say it‚Äôs the threat of a large asteroid hitting our planet. In fact, most people believe that the biggest threat to humanity is some out of this world, unimaginable thing that will wipe out humans in one sweep. Well‚Ä¶ the greatest threat to humanity is right under our noses.

          Everything you need to know about this growing technology
Do You Trust Me? üòà Our entire society runs on trust. You trust your boss to pay you. You trust the government to ensure your security. You trust your bank to not steal your money and run away. We blindly trust so many institutions and people without giving it a second thought.
But what if something happens? Your boss doesn‚Äôt pay you.

          Explaining how these vital visual representations of machine learning models work.
A Data Scientists‚Äô Dilemma Big companies are getting involved with machine learning like never before. Especially with the necessity of data scientists steadily growing in big companies, data scientists bare a big job in the machine learning consulting space. One issue that arises from data scientists in big companies is the issue of communication with other branches in the company.

          The Terrible Tale of Cancer Cancer continues to be one of the world‚Äôs most deadly diseases, killing over 10 million+ people a year. One of the reasons that cancer is so deadly is that if it‚Äôs left unattended even for a short period of time, it can have already taken over a biological system. Early diagnoses are the key to battling cancer, and machine learning is revolutionizing early diagnosis.

          Face it. We‚Äôre dumb. A blindfolded monkey could manage a portfolio better than any human ever could. No, I‚Äôm actually serious. Numerous studies show that monkeys outperform humans in the stock market all the time. A monkey allegedly generated 8x more profit in a quarter than traders on the New York Stock Exchange. How can a clueless primate beat the so-called ‚Äúgeniuses‚Äù of wall street? The answer, dumb luck.

          On February 10th, 1996, IBM‚Äôs Deep Blue AI beat world champion Garry Kasparov at a game of chess.
Google‚Äôs Alpha Go AI is the best GO player in the world and has crushed world champions over and over again.
 But how is this even possible? How is it possible that a computer can outsmart humans? The answer‚Ä¶ Reinforcement Learning.
What is Reinforcement Learning? Reinforcement learning is a branch of Machine Learning and AI.
