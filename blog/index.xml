          Heyo! üëã My name is Vansh Sethi and I am a 16 year-old technologist, particularly interested in the intersections of artificial intelligence and health.
I&amp;rsquo;ve worked at a couple of early stage startups building some machine learning models and A.I tools.
I&amp;rsquo;m trying to meet new people and discuss new ideas and more than anything else, form really awesome relationships.
If you wish to contact me ‚Äîand please feel free to!

          The Greatest Threat to Humanity‚Ä¶ What is the greatest threat to humanity? Some might say that it‚Äôs a nuclear fallout. Others might say it‚Äôs the threat of a large asteroid hitting our planet. In fact, most people believe that the biggest threat to humanity is some out of this world, unimaginable thing that will wipe out humans in one sweep. Well‚Ä¶ the greatest threat to humanity is right under our noses.

Do You Trust Me? üòà Our entire society runs on trust. You trust your boss to pay you. You trust the government to ensure your security. You trust your bank to not steal your money and run away. We blindly trust so many institutions and people without giving it a second thought.
But what if something happens? Your boss doesn‚Äôt pay you.

          Feeling satisfied? ü§î Imagine this. You‚Äôve just finished an enormous project that took you over 100+ hours of work and over 4 months to complete. You‚Äôre tired, and rightfully so. You decide a vacation is in order and take a 2 week break and just relax. Afterwards, you‚Äôre feeling satisfied with your situation and just go back to doing the same kind of stuff. You don‚Äôt want more because you‚Äôre happy with what you‚Äôve got.

          Explaining how these vital visual representations of machine learning models work.
A Data Scientists‚Äô Dilemma Big companies are getting involved with machine learning like never before. Especially with the necessity of data scientists steadily growing in big companies, data scientists bare a big job in the machine learning consulting space. One issue that arises from data scientists in big companies is the issue of communication with other branches in the company.

          The Terrible Tale of Cancer Cancer continues to be one of the world‚Äôs most deadly diseases, killing over 10 million+ people a year. One of the reasons that cancer is so deadly is that if it‚Äôs left unattended even for a short period of time, it can have already taken over a biological system. Early diagnoses are the key to battling cancer, and machine learning is revolutionizing early diagnosis.

          Face it. We‚Äôre dumb. A blindfolded monkey could manage a portfolio better than any human ever could. No, I‚Äôm actually serious. Numerous studies show that monkeys outperform humans in the stock market all the time. A monkey allegedly generated 8x more profit in a quarter than traders on the New York Stock Exchange. How can a clueless primate beat the so-called ‚Äúgeniuses‚Äù of wall street? The answer, dumb luck.

          Gene editing is the process of changing and altering the genetic code of different organisms. The applications for gene editing are vast‚Ä¶ from modifying plants so they have a longer shelf life to fighting genetic diseases, gene editing can do a lot. Even though breakthroughs in gene editing will change the world, should we allow it to? Gene editing has some major drawbacks when you put an ethical lens on it, and in this article I‚Äôll go over some of the main arguments.

          On February 10th, 1996, IBM‚Äôs Deep Blue AI beat world champion Garry Kasparov at a game of chess.
Google‚Äôs Alpha Go AI is the best GO player in the world and has crushed world champions over and over again.
 But how is this even possible? How is it possible that a computer can outsmart humans? The answer‚Ä¶ Reinforcement Learning.
What is Reinforcement Learning? Reinforcement learning is a branch of Machine Learning and AI.
