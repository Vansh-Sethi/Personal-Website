          Heyo! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Vansh Sethi and I am a 16 year-old technologist, particularly interested in the intersections of artificial intelligence and health.
I&amp;rsquo;ve worked at a couple of early stage startups building some machine learning models and A.I tools.
I&amp;rsquo;m trying to meet new people and discuss new ideas and more than anything else, form really awesome relationships.
If you wish to contact me â€”and please feel free to!
